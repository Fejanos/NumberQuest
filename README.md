# Number Quest ðŸŽ²

A simple console-based number guessing game built with **C# .NET** using the **MVC pattern**.  
Players can either guess the programâ€™s secret number or let the program guess their number.  
Game results (player name, secret number, attempts) are stored in a JSON file and displayed in a leaderboard.

## Whatâ€™s here so far
- .NET 8/9 console application
- **MVC structure** (`Models`, `Views`, `Controllers`, `Data`)
- Two game modes:
  - **ProgramRnd** â†’ Player guesses the programâ€™s number
  - **PlayerRnd** â†’ Program guesses the playerâ€™s number
- **Leaderboard** with results saved in `leaderboard.json`
- Display of **player name, secret number, attempts, timestamp**
- JSON-based persistence

### Example gameplay
Player guesses the programâ€™s number
```bash
Iâ€™m thinking of a number between 1 and 100!
Guess: 50
The number is bigger.
Guess: 75
The number is smaller.
Guess: 63
Correct! You guessed it in 3 tries!
```

Program guesses the playerâ€™s number
```bash
Pick a number between 1 and 100. Press 'y' when youâ€™re ready!

Greater or lesser than 50?
'g' | 'l' | '=' if equal
```

### Leaderboard (JSON format)
Game results are stored automatically in leaderboard.json.
```bash
[
  {
    "PlayerName": "Alice",
    "SecretNumber": 63,
    "Attempts": 3,
    "PlayedAt": "2025-09-13T18:23:45"
